                <span style="color: green"> <b> <u> This tutorial is designed for the aspiring Web Designers and Developers with a need to understand the HTML in enough detail along with its simple overview, and practical examples. This tutorial will give you enough ingredients to start with HTML from where
                    you can take yourself at higher level of expertise. </u> </b> </span> 

                <i>
                    This tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs. Each paragraph of
                        text should go in between an opening and closing tag.
                         
            </i>



            </p>
            <p  style="background-color:rgb(171, 225, 234);" class="paragraph" >
                <span style="color: red"> <b><u> If an element carries an id attribute as a unique identifier, it is possible to identify just that element and its content. </u> </b> </span> 

                <i>
                    The id attribute of an HTML tag can be used to uniquely identify any element within an HTML
                    page. There are two primary reasons that you might want to use an id attribute on an
                    element
            </i>
               </p>

            <p  style="background-color:rgb(171, 225, 234);" class="paragraph" >
                <span style="color: black"> <b> <u>If you have two elements of the same name within a Web page (or style sheet), you can use the id attribute to distinguish between elements that have the same name. </u></b> </span> 

<i>
    The title attribute gives a suggested title for the element. They syntax for the title attribute
    is similar as explained for id attribute:
    The behavior of this attribute will depend upon the element that carries it, although it is often
    displayed as a tooltip when cursor comes over the element or while the element is loading.
            </i>
            </p>

            
        </center>

        <p class="paragraph2">
            The class attribute is used to associate an element with a style sheet, and specifies the class
of element. You will learn more about the use of the class attribute when you will learn
Cascading Style Sheet (CSS). So for now you can avoid it.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            The dir attribute allows you to indicate to the browser about the direction in which the text
            should flow. The dir attribute can take one of two values, as you can see in the table that
            follows
